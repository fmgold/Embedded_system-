This repository contains multiple embedded system projects, organized by platform:

- [`Freertos/`](./freertos) – STM32 projects using STM32CubeIDE or Keil
- [`Arduino_projects/`](./Arduino_projects) – Arduino-based microcontroller projects
- [`ESP32_Projects/`](./ESP32_Projects) – ESP32 projects using PlatformIO or Arduino IDE

Each folder includes its own documentation and build instructions.
